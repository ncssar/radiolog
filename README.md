Nevada County Sheriff's Search and Rescue (ncssar-nc.org) has been using this radio log tool on every callout since early 2015.

This open-source project is mainly intended for use by other Search and Rescue teams.

Prior to mid-2022, there was no downloadable installer available, and radiolog was not available as a Windows executable.  Installation was a much more manual process.  See those installation guidelines [here](INSTALL.md).  Thanks to user @erinn for creating the release workflow including the radiolog Windows executable, and the executable installer.

See guidelines for contributing to this project [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The general idea:

General Radio Log management
- Intended to be user-friendly and intuitive, with no training necessary to make use of key features
- Most features are automated
- Less overhead = Reduced Fiddling
- Fewer options = Reduced Fiddling
- Reduced Fiddling = more effective Radio Operator
